Long Video to Short Video Converter
Description

This project is a Python-based tool designed to download long videos from YouTube and convert them into shorter, more engaging clips. It leverages yt-dlp for video downloads and MoviePy for video processing, allowing users to extract specific segments, combine them, add overlays, and optionally include background music.
Whether you're a content creator, marketer, or casual user, this tool simplifies the process of creating highlight reels or social media-ready videos.

Features

Download Videos from YouTube: Download videos directly from YouTube using their URL.
Create Short Clips: Extract specific segments from a video to form a concise, engaging short clip.
Text Overlay: Add custom text overlays to enhance the video.
Background Music: Integrate background music into the final video.
Configurable Timestamps: Easily adjust the start and end times of video clips.
Flexible Output: Saves videos in MP4 format with high-quality audio and video encoding.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
yt-dlp: For downloading videos from YouTube.
moviepy: For video processing (trimming, combining clips, and adding text/audio).
os: For file handling and directory creation.
Additional Tools:
ImageMagick: Required for rendering text overlays with moviepy.
FFmpeg: Used internally by moviepy for efficient video encoding.

Installation
Prerequisites

Install Python (>= 3.7).
Install FFmpeg:
On Windows: Download FFmpeg and add it to your system PATH.

Install ImageMagick (for text rendering):
Download and install from the official website.
Ensure the path to the magick.exe binary is correctly configured in the script.

HIGH LEVEL APPROACH
1. Input: Video URL
Objective: Accept a YouTube video URL as input.
Action: Use a reliable tool (yt-dlp) to download the video in MP4 format.
Output: Save the downloaded video locally for processing.

2. Extract Video Segments
Objective: Identify and extract key portions of the video.
Action: Define timestamps to select interesting clips (e.g., 5–10 seconds, 15–20 seconds, etc.) using moviepy.
Output: Short, individual video clips.

3. Combine Clips
Objective: Create a cohesive short video by merging selected clips.
Action: Use moviepy to concatenate the extracted segments seamlessly.
Output: A single combined video containing all selected clips.

4. Enhance Video
Objective: Add visual and audio enhancements for better engagement.
Text Overlay: Include captions or titles using moviepy.
Background Music: Integrate optional audio to replace or supplement the original audio.
Action: Use TextClip and AudioFileClip to overlay text and audio onto the video.
Output: An enhanced short video with text and/or music.

5. Export Final Video
Objective: Save the processed video in a shareable, high-quality format.
Action: Use moviepy.write_videofile() to export the video with optimized settings (e.g., MP4 with libx264 and aac codecs).
Output: The final short video saved locally.

6. Optional Customizations
Allow users to:
Adjust clip timestamps.
Change text content, font, and position.
Use their own background music file.
